Script for example of processing of barcode SPARseq data, and script and files for downstream analysis for Supplemental Figures 5, 6, and 7.

After processing with the SPARSEQ BARCODES pipeline (https://github.com/wrana-lab/SPARSEQ_BARCODES) the individual run outputs are processed to compile data about barcodes per well. 

BarcodeProcessingExample.R is an example of how to process the outputs from the SPARSEQ BARCODES pipeline, which is done per run. 

allBCdatacombined.R shows how we aggregated the data and generated the QC plots in Supplemental Figures 5, 6, and 7, as well as Supplemental Data 1.
