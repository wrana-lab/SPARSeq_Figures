Script for Figure 6 and examples of Supplemental Figure 12 analysis. 

Figure 6 A shows the flowchart of our analysis process.

Figure 6 B shows the finalized count of S-Rbm putative quasispecies (pQS).

Figure 6 C shows the finalized aligned S-Rbm pQS per VOC.

Supplemental Figure 12 shows the development of the pQS analysis as shown in the flowchart in Fig. 6 A: 

Sup. Fig. 12 A shows the distributions of S-Rbm counts across samples per barcoded run.

Sup. Fig. 12 B shows the series of test cutoffs and linear models we used for our S-Rbm data, to determine a finalized, conservative cutoff for our quasispecies analysis for each run.

Sup. Fig. 12 C shows the same analysis as in B, but for the S-Pbs data. 

Sup. Fig. 12 D shows the finalized count of S-Pbs pQS.

Sup Fig 12 E shows the aligned S-Pbs pQS per VOC.
